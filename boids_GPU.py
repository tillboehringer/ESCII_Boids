    Update the positions and velocities of all boids based on the flocking behavior rules. This kernel computes the

    The spatial partitioning grid is used to efficiently find neighboring boids, significantly speeding up the simulation.

    Mathematical Explanation:
    - Alignment: Steer towards the average velocity of nearby boids. This is achieved by summing the velocities of neighbors
      and normalizing the result to compute the desired velocity direction.
    - Cohesion: Steer towards the center of mass of nearby boids. The center of mass is calculated as the average position
      of neighbors, and the desired direction is the vector pointing from the boid's position to this center.
    - Separation: Steer away from nearby boids that are too close. This is done by summing the normalized vectors pointing
      away from each close neighbor, scaled inversely by their distance to emphasize avoidance of closer boids.

    The forces are combined with respective weights to compute the acceleration for each boid. The velocity is updated
    based on this acceleration, and the speed is clamped to a maximum value to ensure stability.
